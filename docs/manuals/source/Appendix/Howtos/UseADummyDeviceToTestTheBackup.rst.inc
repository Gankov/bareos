-------------------------------------



.. _TestUsingFifoDevice:

 If your are testing your configuration, but donâ€™t want to store the backup data, it is possible to use a dummy FIFO device to test your configuration, see :ref:`Stored configuration <SetupFifo>`.

Obviously, it can not be used to do a restore.
