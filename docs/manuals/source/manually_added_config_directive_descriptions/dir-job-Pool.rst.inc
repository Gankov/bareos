The Pool directive defines the pool of Volumes where your data can be backed up. Many Bareos installations will use only the Default pool. However, if you want to specify a different set of Volumes for different Clients or different Jobs, you will probably want to use Pools. For additional details, see the :ref:`DirectorResourcePool` of this chapter. This directive is required.

In case of a Copy or Migration job, this setting determines which Pool is examined to find JobIds to migrate. If :config:option:`dir/job/SelectionType`\  is SQLQuery, the Pool directive is still used to determine the Storage to read from. Accordingly, the SQL query must only return JobIds from that pool. In any case, the Pool resource defined by the Pool directive must contain a :config:option:`dir/pool/NextPool`\  = ...
directive to define the Pool to which the data will be migrated.
